# Open Source | Algorithms [Beta]

[ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](https://github.com/Verycuteabbey/Algorithms/blob/main/README_CN.md)

## Warning
**This algorithm still in beta, there is no guarantee that there will be no problems during use**
### What is this?
This is a Tween Logic Algorithm for Roblox, you can require() this for instead TweenService (**NOT ALL**)

Algorithm is not finished yet, and also use harder of TweenService (**Hard at source code recompile**)
### Use
`Tween.Create()` is require 7 arguments:
Instance | Property | EaseType | EaseDirection | End | Duration | ExtraProperties

Instance â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Is can be any instances, type check is Instance

Property â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Is require to be "Instance" any property

EaseType â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” You can enable one of this: "Linear", "Quad", "Cubic", "Quart", "Quint", "Sine", "Expo", "Circ", "Elastic", "Back", "Bounce"

EaseDirection â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” You can enable one of this: "In", "Out", "InOut"

End â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Is can be "CFrame", "number", "UDim", "UDim2", "Vector2", "Vector3", depend on your tween property

Duration â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Tween running time

ExtraProperties â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Only for ease style "Elastic" and "Back", see [Extra Properties](https://github.com/Verycuteabbey/Algorithms/blob/main/README.md#extra-properties-not-recommented)

Example: Part's position (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1)
```lua
Tween.Create(game.Workspace.Part, "Position", "Quad", "Out", Vector3.new(1, 1, 1), 1, {});
```
### Extra Properties (**NOT RECOMMENTED**)
Includes 3 arguments, they are "A", "P", "S", all are number
